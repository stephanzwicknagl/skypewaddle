### The story behind _Skype Waddle_

My partner and I were in a long distance relationship for 3 years. We used Skype to talk to each other every day. 

During the pandemic, we would talk for hours and hours. 

We started to wonder how much we actually skyped. That's why I created this tool.

Here, you can analyze how much you video chat with your partner, friends or family. Find out how many hours, how many calls, the duration of your calls over time and more.
